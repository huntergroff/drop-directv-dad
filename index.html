        <p>YouTube TV seems to have the largest selection of channels, plus unlimited cloud DVR. Another advantage is that you can add certain channels as add-ons, including HBO Max, Showtime, or Hallmark Movies Now. There are also add-ons that allow you to stream 4K Video or get more sports channels. One of the largest advantages is also that the base plan allows 3 streams to be running at once, compared to Hulu + Live TV's 2 streams.</p>

          <div id="p2a">
        <p>Hulu + Live TV is great for keeping everything in one place. This way, our Disney+, ESPN, Hulu, and Live TV subscriptions are all tied to one location. Notably, HBO Max and Showtime can also be added as add-on networks, so even these subscriptions could be in one place. (Hulu does not support Hallmark Movies Now, but you could buy this as a separate subscription). Also note that Hulu + Live TV subscribers get access to BONUS streamable movies and shows that not all Hulu subscribers get, so it notably upgrades our options on Hulu itself.</p>

        <p>The smorgasbord plan is really something I put together for fun. It's not very practical because we barely get any live tv or news networks in this plan. HOWEVER, I do think that you should look into some of these streaming services, particularly HBO Max, and consider adding them on to one of the first two plans.</p>
